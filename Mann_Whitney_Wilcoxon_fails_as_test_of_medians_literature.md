I highly recommend reading the following resources - they will clear all doubts, especially if your statistical reviewer claims otherwise and insists that you should use the Mann-Whitney (-Wilcoxon) and Kruskal-Wallis tests for medians without making additional distributional assumptions.
Do not give up, and remember that **inappropriate use of statistical tools can harm science and increase the risk of publishing nonsensical outcomes**.
